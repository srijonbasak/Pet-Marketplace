Introduction
This roadmap outlines the plan for building a Pet Marketplace that integrates e-commerce for pet-related products with a pet adoption and rescue feature. The platform will allow users (buyers, sellers, and NGOs) to interact, purchase products, and adopt/rescue pets. This project is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Vue.js with MVC architecture.

Phase 1: Project Setup & Initial Development
1.1 Set Up the Development Environment
Install Node.js and set up the project directory.

Install Nodemon for live reloading during development.

Initialize the project using npm init and install necessary dependencies:

Express

Mongoose

Body-Parser

JWT

bcryptjs

dotenv

Cors

Nodemon

Set up the MongoDB Atlas cluster and integrate it with the app.

1.2 Set Up Directory Structure
Set up the following folder structure for MVC architecture:

arduino
Copy
Edit
pet-marketplace/
├── controllers/
├── models/
├── routes/
├── views/
├── public/
├── config/
├── app.js
├── .env
└── package.json
1.3 Basic Server Configuration
Configure Express server in app.js to listen for incoming requests.

Set up middleware for parsing JSON and handling CORS.

Phase 2: Core Feature Development
2.1 User Authentication & Authorization
User Model: Create the User model with fields for role (buyer, seller, NGO, etc.), name, email, password, address, and phone.

Authentication Routes:

Register: Implement a registration route to create new users.

Login: Create login functionality using JWT for secure token-based authentication.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement RBAC to manage access based on user roles (buyer, seller, admin, etc.).

2.2 Pet Adoption & Rescue Feature
Pet Model: Define the Pet model with fields like name, breed, age, health status, adoption status, rescue story, and photos.

Pet Listing Routes:

Create Listing: Enable sellers and NGOs to list pets for adoption.

View Listings: Display available pets for adoption with details.

Adoption Request Model: Define the AdoptionRequest model to track adoption requests with status (pending, approved, denied).

Adoption Process:

Allow users to apply for adoption through a form.

Enable NGOs or pet owners to approve or deny adoption requests.

Pet History: Show adoption history and whether the pet was returned.

2.3 Marketplace for Pet Products
Product Model: Define a product model for listing pet-related products (e.g., food, toys).

Product Listing: Allow sellers to list pet products with prices, descriptions, and images.

Product Search & Filters: Implement search functionality and filters for users to find specific products based on pet type, price, and category.

Order Management:

Implement an Order Model to track product purchases.

Allow buyers to view their order status and history.

2.4 Financial Management & Donation Tracking
Revenue Model: Track revenue from product sales using a commission model.

Donation Model: Track donations made to rescue organizations.

Financial Dashboard: Create an admin dashboard to monitor sales, commissions, and donations.

Phase 3: Testing & Optimization
3.1 Unit Testing
Write unit tests for core functionality (e.g., user registration, adoption requests, product creation).

Use Mocha/Chai for backend testing and Jest for frontend testing.

3.2 User Testing
Perform functional and UI/UX testing to ensure a smooth user experience for all roles (buyer, seller, NGO, admin).

Test the adoption and product purchase processes from both user and admin perspectives.

3.3 Performance Optimization
Optimize database queries to handle large amounts of data.

Ensure the platform is responsive and performs well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Implement caching where necessary to improve response times for commonly accessed data (e.g., available pets).
